# Machine-learning-
 bone abnormality classifier which is trained on MURA dataset. It's an open research problem put forth by Stanford ML Group. I have implemented AlexNet and used pre-trained models - Inception-v3, Xception and VGG-19 and attention mechanism is applied on top of all three for training.
